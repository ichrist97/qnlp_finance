# Applying QNLP to sentiment analysis in finance

This repository contains two working examples on how to train a quantum-enhanced LSTM (QLSTM) and a DisCoCat model.

Both training examples are shown in the `training_qlstm.ipynb` and `training_discocat.ipynb` notebooks and use the data sets from the `data` directory.

## Setup

Create a Python 3.x virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
